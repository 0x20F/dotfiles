# TODO: 
* separate `init` script for every module? .zsh has an `init` that only links
.zsh files and installs .zsh plugins, same for all the others
* setup script
    * install rustup, cargo
    * install sheldon
    * symlink oh-my-zsh folder that sheldon downloads
    * symlink `.vimrc`, `.zshrc`
    * install pathogen
    * install pathogen packages (can probably be downloaded with sheldon too)
